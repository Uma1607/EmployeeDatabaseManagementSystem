# EmployeeDatabaseManagementSystem

An Employee Database Management System created using JAVA. Stores employee information such as employee --> id,name,age,salary,gender,date of birth (you can add more attributes if you want:)). To add information, data should be filled in the form and by clicking the ADD NEW button --> information will be effected/updated in the Mysql database as well as in the window. And various other operations can also be perfomed in the java employee management application such as to print a copy of the form entered data there is a PRINT button to print a file in a pdf format,and a RESET button to reset the form data, finally an EXIT button to close the application.

Created using Eclipse IDE
You need not write the whole code , can use New --> Other -->Window Builder --> Application Window --> drag, drop and edit --> code will be auto generated for the elements selected and write logic for the required  operations. ---> Happy Learning :)
